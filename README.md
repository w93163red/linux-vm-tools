# Repo Overview
This repository is the home of a set of bash scripts that enable and configure an enhanced session mode on Linux VM -- Debian, Ubuntu and Kali Linux -- for Hyper-V.

# For Debian User

Currently, I have used the script in Debian Booksworm to let hyper-v support enhance session in Debian. Did not test on Older version. The script is modify from Kali-Linux 2021.x.
